  ** The Problem

  This is a simple IIS 7 module to avoid the zero day vulnerability which targets
  string hash colisions discovered by Alexander "alech" Klink and Julian "zeri"
  Wälde [1] which is described in a security advisory [2].

  There was a security advisory [2] of Microsoft describing the problem and a
  blog post explaing in details the problem [3].

  ** The Proposed Solution
 
  This solution consists in expection the request input before ASP .net and
  detecting duplicated form post hashes.
  
  If the form post is "big" ann contains a duplicated hash then the request
  is rejected.

The vulnerability is better described in these links:
